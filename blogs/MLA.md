# Multihead Latent Attention (MLA)

Multihead Latent Attention (MLA) is an advanced attention mechanism designed to enhance the efficiency and performance of transformer-based models. It builds on traditional multihead attention by incorporating latent representations, enabling more compact and optimized computation, particularly in large-scale models like DeepSeek V3. MLA is especially useful in Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, where it facilitates efficient token routing and expert utilization.

## Key Features
- **Multihead Structure**: Like standard multihead attention, MLA splits attention into multiple heads to capture diverse patterns in the data.
- **Latent Representation**: Introduces a latent projection step, reducing dimensionality and computational overhead while preserving expressive power.
- **Optimized for MoE**: Seamlessly integrates with expert-based systems, balancing workload distribution across experts.

## Implementation
You can find the implementation of Multihead Latent Attention in the DeepSeek V3 repository. However, I performed some experiments, you can get the models in the following link:

Additionally, I conducted some experiments with MLA, and the resulting models are available in the following link:

This implementation showcases how MLA processes queries, keys, and values, with options for both a naive approach and an optimized latent-based approach.

## Research Paper
For a detailed explanation of MLA, including its theoretical foundations and performance benchmarks, refer to the official DeepSeek V3 paper. The paper is linked within the same repository for easy access.

## Usage
To explore MLA in action:
1. Clone the DeepSeek V3 repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.git
